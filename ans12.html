		<p>Climbing down a tree backward is the safest way for a cat because its claws curl forward.<br>Cats often climb down trees backward because their claws are curved and designed for gripping surfaces, like tree bark, more effectively when pulled against the direction of travel. When a cat climbs up a tree, it uses its powerful front leg muscles to pull itself upward while sinking its claws into the tree trunk. The curved shape of the claws allows them to hook onto the bark.</p>
