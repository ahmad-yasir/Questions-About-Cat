		<p>A cat's whiskers, also known as vibrissae, play a crucial role in their sensory perception and overall navigation. These specialized hairs are highly sensitive to touch and can detect even the slightest changes in air currents. This heightened sensitivity allows cats to effectively navigate and explore their surroundings, especially in low-light conditions where their vision may be limited. <br> Whiskers help cats find their way in the dark, sense movement and temperature changes, and detect prey.</p>
