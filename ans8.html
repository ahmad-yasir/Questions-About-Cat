		<p>A cat’s vision cover 285 degrees and a human’s roughly 120 degrees, primarily because its eyes are placed more widely on its face. Humans possess trichromatic vision, allowing them to perceive a wide spectrum of colors, cats have dichromatic vision with a more limited color range. Cats are more sensitive to blue and green wavelengths, but their color perception is less detailed than that of humans. Additionally, cats excel in low-light conditions due to a higher number of rod cells in their retinas, granting them superior night vision compared to humans.</p>
