		<p>Cats are generally kept indoors to ensure their safety and well-being. Indoor living helps protect them from potential dangers such as traffic, predators, and adverse weather conditions. If you want to provide your cat with outdoor experiences, you can consider creating a safe and enclosed outdoor space, commonly known as a catio. This allows your cat to enjoy the sights and sounds of the outdoors while remaining protected.</p>
