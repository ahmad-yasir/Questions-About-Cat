		<p>Cats generally become fertile and capable of reproduction between 5 and 9 months of age. The exact timing can vary depending on factors such as the cat's breed, genetics, and individual development. Some cats may reach sexual maturity as early as 4 months, while others may take up to a year. If you have specific concerns about your cat's reproductive development or if you are considering spaying or neutering, it's recommended to consult with a veterinarian for personalized advice.</p>
